# Task: Add Custom GitLab Instance Support

## Description
Implement support for testing against custom GitLab instances using environment variable configuration. This allows users to validate REPOCLI compatibility with their private GitLab deployments.

⚠️ **CUSTOM INSTANCE ONLY**: This task deals exclusively with GitLab instances. Do NOT mix GitHub Enterprise or other provider concepts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Read GitLab instance configuration from `.tests.conf` file
- [ ] `GITLAB_TEST_INSTANCE` environment variable support implemented
- [ ] Custom GitLab instance URL validation and parsing
- [ ] Test configuration generation for custom instances
- [ ] Documentation for custom instance testing setup
- [ ] Fallback behavior when custom instance is unavailable
- [ ] Integration with existing GitLab test framework

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Extend existing GitLab test configuration with environment variable override
- Key considerations: Handle authentication and network connectivity for private instances
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `tests/cross-testing/lib/provider-config.sh` (modify existing)
  - Custom GitLab test environment configuration
  - Documentation updates for setup instructions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 6: GitLab provider tests must be functional with gitlab.com
- [ ] Understanding of GitLab instance configuration requirements
- [ ] Access to custom GitLab instance for testing (optional)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true (extends existing GitLab functionality)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Environment variable configuration working correctly
- [ ] Custom instance tests execute successfully when configured
- [ ] Graceful handling when custom instance is not configured or available
- [ ] Documentation includes clear setup instructions for users
- [ ] Integration maintains compatibility with existing gitlab.com tests
