# Task: Implement Error Handling and Edge Case Tests

## Description
Create comprehensive error handling tests for network failures, invalid repositories, rate limiting, and other edge cases. Ensure both GitHub and GitLab providers handle errors consistently and gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Network failure simulation and handling validation
- [ ] Invalid repository URL testing (404 errors)
- [ ] Rate limiting detection and graceful degradation
- [ ] Malformed JSON response handling
- [ ] CLI tool unavailability scenarios (gh/glab not installed)
- [ ] Authentication failure scenarios (without requiring real auth)
- [ ] Error message consistency between providers

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Controlled error scenario testing with mocked/simulated failures
- Key considerations: Test error handling without causing actual API issues
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `tests/cross-testing/lib/error-tests.sh` (new)
  - Error simulation utilities and test scenarios

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3: Environment isolation utilities must be available
- [ ] Task 4: JSON comparison engine must handle error responses
- [ ] Understanding of expected error patterns from both providers

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: true (independent error scenarios)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All error scenarios tested and validated
- [ ] Error handling demonstrates consistent behavior across providers
- [ ] Graceful degradation works properly for network/API issues
- [ ] Error tests integrate with main test orchestration
- [ ] Documentation covers error handling capabilities and limitations
