# Task Template → See Global Template

**📍 LOCATION MOVED**: Task template is now located at the global epic level.

**🔗 SEE**: `.claude/epics/TASK-TEMPLATE.md`

This file has been moved to the global `.claude/epics/` directory so that all epics can use the same standardized task creation template.

## Quick Reference

The global TASK-TEMPLATE.md provides:
- ✅ Standard frontmatter with correct field order
- ✅ Empty `github:` field (correct workflow - no pre-filling)
- ✅ Standard section structure (Description, Acceptance Criteria, etc.)
- ✅ Example content patterns
- ✅ Status management guidelines

Use the global template as starting point for all new tasks across all epics.
