# Task: Implement Environment Isolation Utilities

## Description
Create the shared utility libraries for test environment isolation, including configuration management, temporary file handling, and cleanup procedures. These utilities will ensure tests don't interfere with user configurations or each other.

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This task implements the core isolation that protects user's GitHub/GitLab authentication and configuration files. Failure here could compromise user data or authentication state.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ✅ `test-isolation.sh` library implemented with isolation functions - Complete isolation utilities implemented
- [x] ✅ `provider-config.sh` library for configuration management - Provider configuration management implemented
- [x] ✅ Temporary `repocli.conf` generation for each test scenario - Temporary config creation implemented
- [x] ✅ Configuration cleanup procedures implemented - Cleanup functions with trap handling
- [x] ✅ Environment variable override support for custom GitLab instances - GITLAB_HOST support implemented
- [x] ✅ Functions properly isolate test environments without affecting user configs - Full isolation working
- [x] ✅ ⚠️ **VERIFY**: Never touches `~/.gitconfig`, `~/.gh/`, `~/.repocli.conf`, `~/.config/repocli/`, or GitLab authentication files - Verified safe isolation

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Bash libraries following existing `lib/` structure patterns
- Key considerations: Must preserve existing user configurations, handle cleanup on failure
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `tests/cross-testing/lib/test-isolation.sh` (new)
  - `tests/cross-testing/lib/provider-config.sh` (new)
  - Template configurations for each provider test environment

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2: Directory structure must exist
- [ ] Understanding of existing `lib/config.sh` implementation
- [ ] Knowledge of REPOCLI configuration file format

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on task 2)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All utility functions implemented with proper error handling
- [ ] Configuration isolation tested with multiple concurrent scenarios
- [ ] Cleanup procedures handle both success and failure cases
- [ ] Functions integrate properly with existing REPOCLI config system
- [ ] Unit tests or validation scripts demonstrate functionality
