# Task: Create Test Framework Foundation

## Description
Create the basic directory structure and main orchestration script for the cross-testing framework. This includes setting up the `tests/cross-testing/` directory with the main test runner script and defining the overall test execution flow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Directory structure `tests/cross-testing/` created with all subdirectories
- [ ] Main orchestration script `run-cross-tests.sh` implemented
- [ ] Test environment directories (github-test, gitlab-test, gitlab-custom-test) created
- [ ] Basic CLI tool availability checking implemented
- [ ] Test execution flow documented in script comments
- [ ] Script is executable and passes basic syntax validation

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Bash script following existing REPOCLI patterns
- Key considerations: Must not interfere with existing test structure
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `tests/cross-testing/run-cross-tests.sh` (new)
  - `tests/cross-testing/github-test/` (new directory)
  - `tests/cross-testing/gitlab-test/` (new directory) 
  - `tests/cross-testing/gitlab-custom-test/` (new directory)
  - `tests/cross-testing/lib/` (new directory)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Access to existing REPOCLI codebase structure
- [ ] Understanding of current test framework in `tests/run-tests.sh`

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true (independent task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and follows REPOCLI bash patterns
- [ ] Script has proper error handling and debug logging
- [ ] Directory structure matches epic specifications
- [ ] Script passes shellcheck validation
- [ ] Basic functionality tested (dry-run execution)
