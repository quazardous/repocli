# Stream A Progress: GitHub Test Environment Setup

## Task Completion Status
**Issue #2 - Stream A: ✅ COMPLETED**

## Work Completed

### 1. Directory Structure Creation
- ✅ Created `/tests/cross-testing/github-test/` directory
- ✅ Directory has proper permissions (drwxr-xr-x)

### 2. Configuration File Creation
- ✅ Created `/tests/cross-testing/github-test/repocli.conf`
- ✅ Configuration contains: `provider=github`
- ✅ File has proper permissions (rw-r--r--)

### 3. Integration Validation
- ✅ Directory structure recognized by main framework script
- ✅ Framework help output shows GitHub provider option
- ✅ All file permissions are appropriate for test execution

## Files Created
- `/tests/cross-testing/github-test/repocli.conf` - GitHub provider configuration

## Next Steps
- Ready for integration testing with other streams
- Ready for commit to repository

## Notes
- Configuration follows established pattern from `repocli.conf-example`
- Directory naming matches framework expectations (`${provider}-test`)
- All components integrate correctly with existing cross-testing framework
