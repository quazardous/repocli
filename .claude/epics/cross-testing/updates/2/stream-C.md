# Stream C Progress: Custom GitLab Instance Test Environment Setup

**Issue**: #2 - Create Test Framework Foundation  
**Stream**: Stream C - Custom GitLab Instance Test Environment Setup  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Date**: 2025-08-25

## Scope Completed

- **Directory**: `tests/cross-testing/gitlab-custom-test/` ✅
- **Configuration**: `tests/cross-testing/gitlab-custom-test/repocli.conf` ✅
- **Validation**: Directory structure and configuration format ✅
- **Permissions**: Proper file permissions set ✅

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure Created
```
tests/cross-testing/gitlab-custom-test/
└── repocli.conf
```

### Configuration File Content
```bash
provider=gitlab
instance=${GITLAB_TEST_INSTANCE:-gitlab.example.com}
```

### File Permissions Set
- Directory: `755` (rwxr-xr-x)
- Config file: `644` (rw-r--r--)

## Validation Results

- ✅ Directory created successfully at `tests/cross-testing/gitlab-custom-test/`
- ✅ Configuration file created with proper provider and instance variables
- ✅ Framework recognizes the new test environment (verified with `--help` output)
- ✅ Configuration format matches other test environments (github-test, gitlab-test)
- ✅ File permissions set appropriately

## Integration Status

The custom GitLab instance test environment is now ready for:
- Environment variable based instance configuration (`GITLAB_TEST_INSTANCE`)
- Default fallback to `gitlab.example.com`
- Integration with the cross-testing framework
- Parallel execution with other test environments

## Next Steps

Stream C implementation is complete. Ready for:
- Git commit with message: "Issue #2: Create custom GitLab test environment setup"
- Integration testing with full cross-testing framework
- Coordination with other parallel streams (A and B)
