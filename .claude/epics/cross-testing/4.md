# Task: Build JSON Output Comparison Engine

## Description
Implement the core JSON comparison utilities using `jq` for semantic equivalence validation between GitHub and GitLab command outputs. This engine will normalize and compare JSON structures, validate field mappings, and detect meaningful differences while ignoring formatting variations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `output-comparison.sh` library implemented with JSON comparison functions
- [ ] Semantic equivalence validation (field presence, data types, structure)
- [ ] JSON normalization functions to handle formatting differences
- [ ] Field mapping validation for GitLab parameter translations
- [ ] Comparison result reporting with detailed diff output
- [ ] Handle edge cases (empty responses, malformed JSON, missing fields)

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Bash functions using `jq` for JSON processing
- Key considerations: Focus on semantic equivalence rather than exact matching
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `tests/cross-testing/lib/output-comparison.sh` (new)
  - JSON comparison test cases and validation data

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2: Directory structure must exist
- [ ] `jq` tool availability (already used in GitLab provider)
- [ ] Understanding of GitHub vs GitLab JSON output differences

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside task 3)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] JSON comparison engine handles all expected data types and structures
- [ ] Comparison functions provide clear, actionable output for debugging
- [ ] Edge cases are handled gracefully with appropriate error messages
- [ ] Functions are well-documented with example usage
- [ ] Validation tests demonstrate accuracy on sample GitHub/GitLab outputs
