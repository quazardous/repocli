# Task: Performance Optimization and Parallel Execution

## Description
Optimize the cross-testing framework for performance by implementing parallel test execution, timing analysis, and performance monitoring. Ensure the full test suite completes under 2 minutes as specified in success criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parallel execution of independent test scenarios (different providers/commands)
- [ ] Test execution timing and performance monitoring
- [ ] Performance optimization to meet <2 minute total execution time
- [ ] Load balancing between GitHub and GitLab API calls
- [ ] Efficient resource utilization during parallel execution
- [ ] Performance metrics reporting and analysis

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Bash job control and parallel execution patterns
- Key considerations: Balance parallelism with API rate limits and system resources
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `tests/cross-testing/run-cross-tests.sh` (modify for parallel execution)
  - Performance monitoring and reporting utilities
  - Test execution optimization and timing analysis

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 8: Integration with existing test suite must be complete
- [ ] All core testing functionality must be operational
- [ ] Understanding of API rate limits and performance constraints

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (requires full integration to optimize)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Full test suite completes in under 2 minutes
- [ ] Parallel execution reduces total time by at least 50%
- [ ] Performance monitoring provides actionable timing data
- [ ] Resource utilization is optimized for concurrent API calls
- [ ] Performance regression detection capabilities implemented
