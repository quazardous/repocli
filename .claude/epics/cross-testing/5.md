# Task: Implement GitHub Provider Tests

## Description
Create minimal validation tests for GitHub provider since it's a 1:1 passthrough to `gh` CLI. Focus on basic connectivity, JSON output validation, and establishing the baseline behavior that GitLab tests will compare against.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Issue listing test: `repocli issue list` on public repository (microsoft/vscode)
- [ ] Issue viewing test: `repocli issue view <number>` with JSON output
- [ ] Authentication status test: `repocli auth status` 
- [ ] Basic error handling test: invalid repository or network failure
- [ ] JSON output capture and validation for baseline comparison
- [ ] Test execution time under 10 seconds per command

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Bash test functions integrated with test framework
- Key considerations: Minimal testing since GitHub is 1:1 passthrough, focus on baseline establishment
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `tests/cross-testing/lib/github-tests.sh` (new)
  - GitHub-specific test configurations and expected outputs

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3: Environment isolation utilities must be available
- [ ] Task 4: JSON comparison engine must be functional
- [ ] `gh` CLI tool installed and functional
- [ ] Internet connectivity to GitHub API

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside GitLab tests)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All GitHub test functions implemented and passing
- [ ] Baseline JSON outputs captured for GitLab comparison
- [ ] Error handling validates expected failure scenarios
- [ ] Tests integrate properly with main test orchestration
- [ ] Performance requirements met (under 10 seconds per command)
