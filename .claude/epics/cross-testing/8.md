# Task: Integrate with Existing Test Suite

## Description
Integrate the cross-testing framework with the existing REPOCLI test infrastructure. Extend `tests/run-tests.sh` and `make test` command to include cross-provider validation as part of the standard testing workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cross-testing integrated into existing `tests/run-tests.sh`
- [ ] `make test` command includes cross-provider validation
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline compatibility maintained
- [ ] Optional cross-testing execution (can be skipped if CLI tools unavailable)
- [ ] Test output integrated with existing reporting format
- [ ] Performance impact minimized (parallel execution where possible)

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Extend existing test framework without breaking current functionality
- Key considerations: Maintain backward compatibility, handle optional dependencies gracefully
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `tests/run-tests.sh` (modify existing)
  - `Makefile` (modify test target if needed)
  - Integration hooks for cross-testing orchestration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2: Test framework foundation must be complete
- [ ] Task 5: GitHub tests must be functional
- [ ] Task 6: GitLab tests must be functional  
- [ ] Task 7: Error handling must be implemented
- [ ] Understanding of existing test infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all core testing tasks to be complete)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Cross-testing seamlessly integrated with existing workflow
- [ ] `make test` includes cross-provider validation
- [ ] Integration handles missing CLI tools gracefully
- [ ] Test output follows existing format and reporting standards
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline continues to work without modification
