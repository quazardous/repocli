# Task Standards → See Global Standards

**📍 LOCATION MOVED**: Task standards are now located at the global epic level.

**🔗 SEE**: `.claude/epics/TASK-STANDARDS.md`

This file has been moved to the global `.claude/epics/` directory so that all epics can use the same standardized task documentation format, workflow rules, and GitHub integration patterns.

## Quick Reference

The global TASK-STANDARDS.md contains:
- ✅ Frontmatter standards and field definitions
- ✅ Status workflow (open → in_progress → completed)
- ✅ GitHub integration workflow with verification requirements
- ✅ File naming consistency rules
- ✅ Mandatory verification algorithm for file-GitHub number consistency
- ✅ Cross-provider status mapping reference

Use the global standards for all new epics and tasks.
