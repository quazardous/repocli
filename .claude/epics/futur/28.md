# Task: GitHub Label Integration for Enhanced Workflow Automation

## Description
**üîÆ FUTUR EPIC**: This task is part of the virtual futur epic and is not included in the current cross-testing epic scope.

Implement automated GitHub label management to enhance the task workflow system. This will provide visual indicators of task status, priority, and type directly in GitHub issues, complementing the primary issue status field approach.

**üéØ PRIMARY FOCUS**: Automate label synchronization with task status changes and provide enhanced workflow automation.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENT STATUS**: Task status management currently relies on manual GitHub issue status updates and frontmatter.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Automated Label Sync**: Labels automatically update when task status changes
- [ ] **Status Labels**: Labels reflect task status (in-progress, blocked, needs-review, etc.)
- [ ] **Priority Labels**: Support for priority indicators (high, medium, low)
- [ ] **Type Labels**: Task type classification (bug, feature, documentation, test)
- [ ] **Area Labels**: Component/area classification for task organization
- [ ] **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated workflow triggers based on label changes
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Existing manual status management continues to work
- [ ] **Documentation**: Usage instructions and label management guidelines provided

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: GitHub Actions workflow for label automation with webhook triggers
- **Key considerations**: Maintain GitHub issue status as primary method, labels as enhancement
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `.github/workflows/label-sync.yml` (new)
  - `.github/labels.yml` (label definitions)
  - `scripts/sync-task-labels.sh` (label synchronization logic)

## Implementation Requirements

### Primary Deliverable: `.github/workflows/label-sync.yml`

**üéØ KEY PRINCIPLE**: Labels enhance but never replace the primary GitHub issue status field approach.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow for automated label management
name: Task Label Synchronization
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, closed, reopened]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]

jobs:
  sync-labels:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Sync Task Labels
        uses: ./.github/actions/sync-task-labels
```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2: Test Framework Foundation (completed)
- [ ] Task 3: Environment Isolation Utilities (completed)
- [ ] Task 4: JSON Output Comparison Engine (completed)
- [ ] Task 5: GitHub Provider Tests (completed)
- [ ] Task 6: GitLab Provider Tests (completed)
- [ ] GitHub Actions environment and permissions
- [ ] REPOCLI task management system understanding

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: false (requires existing task system understanding)

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Example 1: Automatic label sync when status changes
# When task status changes from "open" to "in_progress"
# Automatically adds "status: in progress" label

# Example 2: Priority and type classification
# Issue with labels: "priority: high", "type: bug", "area: gitlab-provider"

# Example 3: Workflow automation
# Labels trigger different GitHub Actions workflows
# "needs-review" label triggers review assignment automation
```

This task enhances workflow visibility and automation while maintaining the GitHub issue status field as the primary management method.

## Status Management

**PRIMARY**: Manage task status via GitHub issue status field using the values defined in TASK-STANDARDS.md

**CURRENT**: Manual status updates in frontmatter and GitHub issue
**ENHANCEMENT**: Automated label synchronization and workflow triggers
