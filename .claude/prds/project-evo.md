# PRD: project-evo

## Executive Summary

Project Evolution (project-evo) represents the next major iteration of REPOCLI, transforming it from a CLI compatibility wrapper into a comprehensive Git workflow automation platform. This evolution builds on the solid foundation established by the current REPOCLI system while addressing scalability, maintainability, and user experience challenges identified through usage and feedback.

**Value Proposition**: Transform fragmented Git provider workflows into a unified, intelligent automation platform that adapts to team practices and scales with organizational needs.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

**1. Limited Provider Ecosystem**
- REPOCLI currently supports GitHub and GitLab with basic Gitea/Codeberg stubs
- Enterprise users need BitBucket, Azure DevOps, and custom Git providers
- Each new provider requires extensive manual implementation

**2. Static Command Translation**
- Current approach is 1:1 command mapping without workflow intelligence
- No adaptation to team-specific processes or organizational standards
- Limited automation capabilities beyond basic command wrapping

**3. Scalability and Maintainability Issues**
- Complex GitLab provider code becoming harder to maintain (addressed by Task #35)
- Inconsistent error handling and testing coverage
- No plugin architecture for extensibility

**4. User Experience Gaps**
- Configuration complexity for multi-provider environments
- Limited workflow automation and customization
- No team collaboration features or shared configurations

### Why This Evolution is Critical Now

1. **Market Opportunity**: Growing demand for unified DevOps tooling
2. **Technical Debt**: Current architecture reaching limits of maintainability
3. **User Feedback**: Requests for enhanced automation and provider support
4. **Competitive Positioning**: Need to differentiate from simple CLI wrappers

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**1. DevOps Engineer (Sarah)**
- Manages multiple repositories across GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket
- Needs consistent workflows regardless of provider
- Values automation and scripting capabilities

**2. Team Lead (Marcus)**
- Oversees team workflows and standards
- Needs to enforce consistent practices across projects
- Requires visibility into team activity and metrics

**3. Enterprise Admin (Lisa)**
- Manages organization-wide Git provider configurations  
- Needs security, compliance, and audit capabilities
- Requires scalable deployment and management

### Detailed User Journeys

**Journey 1: Multi-Provider Workflow Automation**
```
As Sarah (DevOps Engineer)
I want to define workflow templates that work across all our Git providers
So that I can maintain consistency regardless of where code is hosted

Acceptance Criteria:
- Define workflow templates (e.g., "release-process", "hotfix-workflow")
- Apply templates across GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket repositories
- Templates adapt to provider-specific capabilities automatically
- Template versioning and sharing capabilities
```

**Journey 2: Intelligent Provider Selection**
```
As Marcus (Team Lead)  
I want REPOCLI to intelligently choose the best provider for specific operations
So that team members don't need to remember provider-specific differences

Acceptance Criteria:
- Auto-detect repository provider from git remote
- Route commands to appropriate provider automatically
- Fallback strategies when preferred provider unavailable
- Override capabilities for specific scenarios
```

**Journey 3: Enterprise Configuration Management**
```
As Lisa (Enterprise Admin)
I want to centrally manage REPOCLI configurations for all team members
So that security policies and standards are consistently enforced

Acceptance Criteria:
- Central configuration server with role-based access
- Policy enforcement (approved providers, required workflows)
- Audit logging and compliance reporting
- Automated configuration distribution
```
